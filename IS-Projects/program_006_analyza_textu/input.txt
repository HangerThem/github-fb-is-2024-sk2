### **How to Build an Accord**

1. **Select Notes**: Choose top, heart, and base notes that complement each other and work within the theme of your accord. For example, for a **woody floral accord**, you might choose **sandalwood** (base), **jasmine** (heart), and **lavender** (top).
   
2. **Blend Gradually**: Start with a primary note (often the base), and layer complementary notes gradually. Ensure that the notes blend harmoniously and don't compete for attention.

3. **Test and Adjust**: Fragrance creation is about trial and error. Test your blends on a strip or on skin and adjust proportions or ingredients if necessary. Small changes can make a big difference.

4. **Balance Freshness and Depth**: Ensure the fragrance is balanced. A fragrance might start too sharp and fresh or too heavy. The key is moderation—ensure the top notes are vibrant but not overpowering, and the base notes are grounded but not too strong.
